# SecureScan Pro - Advanced Security Scanning Platform v3.0

## Overview

SecureScan Pro is a next-generation comprehensive security scanning platform that integrates 20+ advanced security testing tools for automated vulnerability assessment. The application provides a sophisticated web-based interface for initiating, monitoring, and reporting on various types of security scans including subdomain enumeration, XSS detection, SQL injection testing, network scanning, AI-powered vulnerability analysis, business logic testing, and advanced OSINT gathering.

The platform follows a cutting-edge full-stack architecture with a React frontend for user interaction and an Express.js backend that orchestrates Python-based security tools enhanced with machine learning capabilities. Real-time updates are delivered through WebSocket connections, providing live feedback on scan progress, advanced analytics, and AI-powered risk assessment.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing modern tooling including:
- **Vite** for build tooling and development server with hot module replacement
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components for consistent, dark-themed styling
- **React Router (Wouter)** for client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation for form handling

The frontend implements a dashboard-centric design with real-time status updates, scan management interfaces, and detailed reporting capabilities.

### Backend Architecture
The server-side follows an Express.js-based REST API architecture with:
- **TypeScript** for type safety across the application
- **Express.js** middleware for request processing, logging, and error handling
- **WebSocket server** for real-time communication with clients
- **Modular service layer** separating business logic (scan orchestration, tool management)
- **Python tool integration** through subprocess execution with timeout controls

The backend manages scan lifecycle states, coordinates multiple security tools, and provides progress tracking through WebSocket broadcasts.

### Advanced Data Storage Solutions
The application uses an enhanced hybrid storage approach:
- **PostgreSQL database** with Drizzle ORM for persistent data storage
- **In-memory storage** fallback for development and testing environments
- **Advanced database schemas** for users, scans, vulnerabilities, tool status, threat intelligence, and scan reports
- **JSONB fields** for storing flexible scan results, AI analysis, and configuration data
- **Risk scoring system** with automated vulnerability severity calculation
- **Threat intelligence integration** with CVE correlation and exploit tracking
- **Advanced analytics** with vulnerability trends and tool performance metrics

### Authentication and Authorization
Currently implements a basic session-based authentication system with:
- User account management through PostgreSQL storage
- Session handling via connect-pg-simple middleware
- Placeholder authentication structure ready for enhancement

### Advanced Tool Integration Architecture
Security tools are integrated through an advanced Python-based execution framework:
- **Subprocess management** with configurable timeouts and error handling
- **Standardized tool output** parsing to common vulnerability schema
- **Tool status monitoring** with success rate tracking and health checks
- **Concurrent execution** support for parallel scan operations
- **AI-powered analysis** for vulnerability correlation and risk assessment
- **Wordlist integration** with SecLists, custom payloads, and nuclei templates
- **Real-time progress tracking** with detailed execution metrics

The system supports comprehensive tool categories:
- **Subdomain enumeration**: Sublist3r, Subfinder, Sudomy, Dome
- **XSS detection**: XSStrike, Dalfox, XSS-Checker, xssFuzz with 1000+ payloads
- **SQL injection testing**: SQLMap, Ghauri, GraphQLmap, SQLiDetector with advanced payloads
- **Network scanning**: Nmap, Masscan, Metasploit integration
- **Advanced web scanning**: Nuclei with 10,000+ templates, directory fuzzing
- **AI vulnerability analysis**: Machine learning-based threat detection
- **Business logic testing**: Advanced logic flaw detection
- **Template injection**: SSTI, prototype pollution detection
- **OSINT gathering**: DNS, WHOIS, certificate analysis, threat intelligence

### Real-time Communication
WebSocket implementation provides:
- Live scan progress updates with percentage completion
- Real-time vulnerability discovery notifications
- Tool status changes and health monitoring
- Terminal-style output streaming for scan logs

## External Dependencies

### Database Services
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with Neon serverless hosting support
- **Drizzle ORM** for database schema management and migrations
- **connect-pg-simple** for PostgreSQL-backed session storage

### UI Framework and Styling
- **Radix UI** component primitives for accessible, unstyled components
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom cyber-security theme
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **shadcn/ui** component system for pre-built, customizable components

### Security Tool Dependencies
Python-based tools requiring specific packages:
- **DNS resolution** libraries (dnspython, python-whois)
- **HTTP clients** (requests, urllib3) for web application testing
- **SSL/TLS analysis** (pyOpenSSL, cryptography)
- **Web scraping** (beautifulsoup4, lxml, selenium)
- **Network scanning** (python-nmap, masscan integration)

### Development and Build Tools
- **Vite** with React plugin for fast development and optimized production builds
- **esbuild** for server-side bundling and performance optimization
- **TypeScript** for compile-time type checking across frontend and backend
- **Replit integration** plugins for development environment compatibility

### External APIs and Services
The platform is designed to integrate with:
- **Shodan API** for internet-wide device scanning
- **CVE databases** for vulnerability correlation
- **Certificate transparency logs** for subdomain discovery
- **DNS resolvers** for domain intelligence gathering

The architecture supports horizontal scaling through service separation and can accommodate additional security tool integrations through the standardized Python tool execution framework.
